# Goal of the project
The goal of the project is to test the data that you have receive from a excel file, onto a web-base application. I used the software "UiPath" to do the automation and testing, to read the data from the excel file and retrieve the Zone -, Category -, and Device data in their respected sheets in the excel. From there the automation load the data onto the web-base application without you to do it manually. This saves a lot of time, and work effort, because if the data gets more and more, the employee does not have to add the files manually.

# Struggles - UiPath
I tried to add the register and login into the automation, but could not make it work. The automation broke and the other automation broke. I also tried to include the Update and Delete function so that the user can do it, but like the login and register, I removed it because it broke the other automation that worked. 

# Struggles - Publish
I was not able to publish the project through the UiPath, so I left the UiPath project in the Repository on Github.
